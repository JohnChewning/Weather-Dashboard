# Weather-Dashboard

# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Introduction

A Weather Dashboard with Current Weather and a Five day forecast. Weather includes Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, and UV Index.

## Project Overview

The goal with this project was to create a Weather Dashboard that allows a user to search for a city and then get the weather information for the current day as well as a five day forecast. The cities searched by a user will be saved in the local storage and will create a search history button that will be able to call the weather once again from a previously searched city.

## Installation

Pushed the code into the github repository and deployed in into github pages. For review and grading purposes, the application is deployed at [(https://johnchewning.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/)]. 

## Usage

When the user enters a city in the search bar, the current weather will appear to the right. A five day weather forecast will appear beneath it.
When the user inputs a city, the data is saved in local storage. When you refresh the page, the saved events will persist.

## Challenges

Getting the API key to work! Creating the parameters for lat and long were a struggle. Getting the API key to work inside of the URL took the longest.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to use OPenWeatherMap API combined with Dayjs and jQuery to create a dynamic Weather-Dashboard.

## Future Development

I would like to figure out how to better style my page with bootstrap or tailwind.
